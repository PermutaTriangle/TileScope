    The factor strategy that decomposes a tiling into its connected factors.

    The factors are the connected components of the graph of the tiling, where
    vertices are the cells. Two vertices are connected if there exists a

    connected if they share the same row or column unless the interleaving or

    When point interleavings are allowed, two cells in the same row or column
    are not connected. When general interleavings are allowed, two cells in the
    same row or column are not connected.
