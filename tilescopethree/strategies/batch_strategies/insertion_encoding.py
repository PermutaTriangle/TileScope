    Insert a new maximum as in the insertion encoding.

    The insertion encoding strategy is a batch strategy which takes in a 1 x n
    tiling where it is assumed that all cells contains a point requirement. It
    considers where the lowest entry is of a gridded permutation is on this
    tiling and places it into its cell. It will place this as one of four
    options, in correspondence with the letters in the insertion encoding:
        - f: it is the only point in the cell
        - l: it is the leftmost point in the cell, and there will be a point
             appearing to the right of it in this cell
        - r: it is the rightmost point in the cell, and there will be a point
             appearing to the left of it in this cell
        - m: it is in the middle and there will be a point appearing to the
             right and left of it in this cell.
