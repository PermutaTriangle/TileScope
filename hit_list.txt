Suggestion for hierarchy of (mixtures of) proof strategies.
The idea is when we put multiple bases on a cluster (like Av(P,Q) with P subset
in S3 and Q subset in S4) we start at the easy end of the hierarchy and do all
the bases we can do with 0, then we apply 1 to the rest, then we apply 2 ...

0 = row/colum-insertion
1 = cell-insertion
2 = 0 & 1
3 = 0 & row/column-separation (used to be called proof strategy b)
4 = 1 & row/column-separation (used to be called proof strategy b)
5 = 0 & recursion
6 = 1 & recursion
7 = 2 & recursion
8 = 3 & recursion
9 = 4 & recursion

Then there are several versions of recursion
a = Unmixed single component obtained by reversibly deleting single cells, recursing to meta-ancestors
b = Possibly mixed version of a
...

The classes we want ATRAP to find a proof tree for

[X] Every subset of S3 (just need 123)

[ ] Every Av(p,q) with p in S3, q in S4

[ ] More generally Av(P,Q) with P subset of S3, Q subset in S4

[ ] First basis (starting at the largest) that struct fails on; it has 11 length 4 patterns and we found a proof tree by hand

[ ] All the Kuszmaul examples; as Jay pointed out to me at Dartmouth most of them have a regular insertion encoding - Struct could do all of those ones, plus one more. There are still two undone

[ ] Every subset of S4 with four or more patterns

[ ] Almost all subsets of S4 with three patterns

[ ] The easy 2x4 classes, e.g., the ones with a rational generating function

[ ] The separable permutations -- Av(2413, 3142)

[ ] The skew-merged permutations -- Av(2143, 3412)

[ ] Av(3124,4312), enumerated in Jay's first paper

[ ] The classes involved in "unbalanced Wilf equivalences" from (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1402.3842.pdf), (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.0230.pdf), and many conjectures that Jay has computed.

[ ] Arc permutations (the basis is 8 patterns of length 4, see https://dmtcs.episciences.org/3037/pdf)

[ ] Permutations drawn on an X and a diamond (geometric grid classes, see https://arxiv.org/pdf/0710.5168.pdf) -- (The X class is Av(2143,2413,3142,3412), which we've already proved on paper)

[ ] Some horizontal juxtapositions like the > class juxtaposed with the < class. (Sam Miner and I tried to enumerate this once to prove that the horizontal juxtaposition of two rational classes can be non-rational.) [Note that the basis of a juxtaposition can be computed from the bases of the two sides.]

[ ] The Shubert variety classes (one of Albert and Brignall, a more complicated one of Masaki Ikeda (alex woo's student))

[ ] The substitution closure of Av(321), which equals Av(25314, 35142, 41352, 42513, 362514, 531642) (see a paper of Atkinson, Ruskuc, and Smith)

[ ] The three 2x4 classes Jay's C-machines paper with Michael, Cheyne, Nathaniel, and Vince

[ ] Some principle classes; Av(1234) would be nice, since it has D-finite generating function

[ ] Av(1324), at least some very tight bounds
