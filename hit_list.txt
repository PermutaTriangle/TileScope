The classes we want ATRAP to find a proof tree for

* Every subset of S3 (just need 123)
* Every Av(p,q) with p in S3, q in S4
* More generally Av(P,Q) with P subset of S3, Q subset in S4
* First basis (starting at the largest) that struct fails on; it has 11 length 4 patterns and we found a proof tree by hand
* All the Kuszmaul examples; as Jay pointed out to me at Dartmouth most of them have a regular insertion encoding - Struct could do all of those ones, plus one more. There are still two undone
* Every subset of S4 with four or more patterns
* Almost all subsets of S4 with three patterns
* The easy 2x4 classes, e.g., the ones with a rational generating function
* The separable permutations
* Av(3124,4312), enumerated in Jay's first paper
* The three 2x4 classes Jay's C-machines paper with Michael, Cheyne, Nathaniel, and Vince
* Some principle classes; Av(1234) would be nice, since it has D-finite generating function
* Av(1324), at least some very tight bounds
