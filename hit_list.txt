The classes we want ATRAP to find a proof tree for

* Every subset of S3 (just need 123)

* Every Av(p,q) with p in S3, q in S4

* More generally Av(P,Q) with P subset of S3, Q subset in S4

* First basis (starting at the largest) that struct fails on; it has 11 length 4 patterns and we found a proof tree by hand

* All the Kuszmaul examples; as Jay pointed out to me at Dartmouth most of them have a regular insertion encoding - Struct could do all of those ones, plus one more. There are still two undone

* Every subset of S4 with four or more patterns

* Almost all subsets of S4 with three patterns

* The easy 2x4 classes, e.g., the ones with a rational generating function

* The separable permutations -- Av(2413, 3142)

* The skew-merged permutations -- Av(2143, 3412)

* Av(3124,4312), enumerated in Jay's first paper

* The classes involved in "unbalanced Wilf equivalences" from (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1402.3842.pdf), (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.0230.pdf), and many conjectures that Jay has computed.

* Arc permutations (the basis is 8 patterns of length 4, see https://dmtcs.episciences.org/3037/pdf)

* Permutations drawn on an X and a diamond (geometric grid classes, see https://arxiv.org/pdf/0710.5168.pdf) -- (The X class is Av(2143,2413,3142,3412), which we've already proved on paper)

* Some horizontal juxtapositions like the > class juxtaposed with the < class. (Sam Miner and I tried to enumerate this once to prove that the horizontal juxtaposition of two rational classes can be non-rational.) [Note that the basis of a juxtaposition can be computed from the bases of the two sides.]

* The Shubert variety classes (one of Albert and Brignall, a more complicated one of Masaki Ikeda (alex woo's student))

* The substitution closure of Av(321), which equals Av(25314, 35142, 41352, 42513, 362514, 531642) (see a paper of Atkinson, Ruskuc, and Smith)

* The three 2x4 classes Jay's C-machines paper with Michael, Cheyne, Nathaniel, and Vince

* Some principle classes; Av(1234) would be nice, since it has D-finite generating function

* Av(1324), at least some very tight bounds
