Doing depth 5
on the tiling:
+-+
|1|
+-+
1: Av(Perm((1, 3, 0, 2)), Perm((2, 0, 3, 1)))
we get the following strategy
We perform cell insertion into cell (0, 0); either it is empty or Av+(Perm((1, 3, 0, 2)), Perm((2, 0, 3, 1))).

The tiling

is verified using the strategy:
Verified because it is a one by one tiling with a subclass
attempting AND node propagation
Verified because it is a one by one tiling with a subclass
we're attempting to combine on an AND node

the tilings in this set are
our guess is:
