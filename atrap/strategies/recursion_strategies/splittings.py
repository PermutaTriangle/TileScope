    ==================

    We need a "recursive cleaner". A recursive strategy may return a boatload of redudant splittings.
    For example, suppose the tiling T splits into five parts A / B / C / D / E, where B / C / D / E are
    all subset verified. Clearly we don't want to consider the many different options formed by combining 
    B / C / D / E in various ways, such as:
      A / B / C / D / E
      A / BC / DE
      A / BCD / E
      A / BCDE
      etc

    But, we also don't necessarily want to just combine them all together! For example, suppose T splits
    into three parts A / B / C, where B and C are subset verified. It's possible that A is not an ancestor
    but A+B together will be. In which case, the splitting A / B / C does us no good, but AB / C does!

    I think the right place for this analysis is not within the Rescursive Strategy, but back in the Metatree.
    So, this will return the "maximally split" splittings, and leave it to the metatree to decide what to
    do with them.

    ==================

    Currently, points are NOT shared between components of a splitting

    ==================

    TOTHINK: Do we need to check every length UP TO the verification length or can we just check the
       verification length itself? If we don't NEED TO, then is it maybe advantageous anyway because
       we can exit early?
