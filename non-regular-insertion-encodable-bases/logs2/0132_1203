The strategies applied were:
Batch: all_cell_insertions, all_row_and_column_insertions, all_point_isolations
Equivalent: all_point_placements, all_equivalent_point_isolations, point_separation
Inferral: empty_cell_inferral, row_and_column_separation, subclass_inferral
Recursive: splittings
Verification: subset_verified, is_empty
The 1 symmetries of the basis were used

There were 959424 inferral cache hits and 6841365 partitioning cache hits.
The partitioning cache had 25 tilings in it right now.
The inferral cache has 100000 tilings in it right now.
There were 114426 tilings of which 2377 are verified.
There were 25443 SiblingNodes of which 890 are verified.

The function splittings called the partitioning cache *6845246* times, (15996 originating)
There were 0 cache misses
