There were 497400 inferral cache hits and 60578 partitioning cache hits.
The partitioning cache had 5 tilings in it right now.
The inferral cache has 100000 tilings in it right now.
There were 58318 tilings of which 1538 are verified.
There were 22276 SiblingNodes of which 1025 are verified.

The function cells_of_occurrences_by_perms called the partitioning cache *64332* times, (32235 originating)
There were 8 cache misses
