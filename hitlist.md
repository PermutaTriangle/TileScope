Freely-braided permutations 3421_4231_4312_4321
Example from p. 191 in Zeilberger's original enumeration schemes paper 1234_1324_1243


The classes we want ATRAP to find a proof tree for

- [x] Every subset of S3.
    We can do all subsets, except 123 (and symmetries) without interleaving

- [x] Every Av(p,q) with p in S3, q in S4.
      Every case done without interleaving

- [x] More generally Av(P,Q) with P subset of S3, Q subset in S4.
      We can do all subsets, except 123 (and symmetries) without interleaving

- [x] First basis (starting at the largest) that struct fails on; it has 11 length 4 patterns and we found a proof tree by hand

- [x] All the Kuszmaul examples. **These have been removed in the most recent version of his paper.** Most of them have a regular insertion encoding - Struct could do all of those ones, plus one more. Here are the smallest bases:
    - [x] 0213_0231_0321_1302_3021
    - [x] 0213_0231_0321_1032_2031
    - [x] 0231_0312_0321_1302_3021
    - [x] 0231_0312_0321_1302_2031

- [ ] Every subset of S4 with four or more patterns

- [ ] Almost all subsets of S4 with three patterns

- [ ] The easy 2x4 classes, e.g., the ones with a rational generating function

- [x] The separable permutations -- Av(2413,3142)

- [ ] **The skew-merged permutations Av(2143,3412) (1032_2301). There is a file for these in examples length/2x4**

- [ ] Av(3124,4312) (0132_1320), enumerated in Jay's first paper

- [ ] The classes involved in "unbalanced Wilf equivalences" from (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1402.3842.pdf), (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.0230.pdf), and many conjectures that Jay has computed.

- [x] Arc permutations (the basis is 8 patterns of length 4, see https://dmtcs.episciences.org/3037/pdf)

- [x] Permutations drawn on an X and a diamond (geometric grid classes, see https://arxiv.org/pdf/0710.5168.pdf): Av(2143,2413,3142,3412) (1032_1302_2031_2301)

- [ ] Permutations drawn on a diamond (geometric grid classes, see https://arxiv.org/pdf/0710.5168.pdf): Is it this one Av(3412,3421,4312,4321) (0123_0132_1023_1032)? **This is regular insertion encodable**

- [ ] Some horizontal juxtapositions like the > class juxtaposed with the < class. (Sam Miner and I tried to enumerate this once to prove that the horizontal juxtaposition of two rational classes can be non-rational.) [Note that the basis of a juxtaposition can be computed from the bases of the two sides.]

- [ ] The Shubert variety classes (one of Albert and Brignall, a more complicated one of Masaki Ikeda (alex woo's student))
    - [ ] LCI Schubert varieties 53241_52341_52431_35142_42513_426153
    - [x] DBI

- [ ] The substitution closure of Av(321), which equals Av(25314, 35142, 41352, 42513, 362514, 531642) (see a paper of Atkinson, Ruskuc, and Smith)

- [ ] The three 2x4 classes Jay's in C-machines paper with Michael, Cheyne, Nathaniel, and Vince
    - [ ] Av(4123,4231,4312) (0132_0213_0321)
    - [ ] 0132_0213
    - [x] Av(4231,4312,4321) (0123_0132_0213) (Generated by the F+ machine)
    - [x] 0231_0312_0321 (Generated by the F- machine)
    - [ ] Av(4123,4231) (0213_0321)
    - [ ] Av(4123,4312) (0132_0321)
    - [ ] Av(4231,4321) (0123_0213)

- [x] The SchrÃ¶der classes

- [ ] The smooth classes

- [x] Av(1234) would be nice, since it has D-finite generating function

- [ ] Some principle classes besides the monotone one

- [ ] Av(1324), at least some very tight bounds
